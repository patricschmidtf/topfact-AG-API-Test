What is a Large Language Model?

A Large Language Model (LLM) is an AI system that can understand and generate language by training with large amounts of text. It uses embedding models to convert words into numerical vectors that capture their meaning in context. Using neural networks, it processes these vectors, learns linguistic structures and generates answers, texts or new information based on them.
