## Overview
This document provides a detailed overview of the system architecture, explaining each component and its role within the system. The goal is to ensure that anyone reviewing this diagram can understand and work with the system effectively.

## Components

### 1. User Interface
- **User**: The starting point where users interact with the system.
- **Input/Output TNC**: This component handles the initial input and output operations from the user.

### 2. Web Application
- **Web App**: The central component that processes user inputs and coordinates with other system components.

### 3. Data Processing
- **Embedding Model**: This model processes the input data to create embeddings, which are then used for further analysis.
- **Vectorize**: Converts data into vector format for efficient processing and storage.
- **Vectorize DB**: A database that stores the vectorized data for quick retrieval and analysis.

### 4. Search and Storage
- **Azure Search**: A search service that indexes and retrieves data from the databases.
- **Azure SQL DB**: A relational database that stores structured data.
- **Azure Storage**: Used for storing large amounts of unstructured data.

### 5. AI Integration
- **OpenAI**: This component interacts with the OpenAI API to generate responses to user queries.
- **Respond the answer to the relative questions**: Processes the responses generated by OpenAI and sends them back to the user.
- **Relative data and the questions**: Stores the data and questions used for generating responses.

## Data Flow
1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the system through the Input/Output TNC.
2. **Web App Processing**: The Web App receives user inputs and coordinates with the Embedding Model, Vectorize, and Azure Search.
3. **Data Embedding and Vectorization**: The Embedding Model processes the input data, and the Vectorize component converts it into vectors, which are stored in the Vectorize DB.
4. **Search and Retrieval**: Azure Search indexes the data from Vectorize DB and Azure SQL DB, and retrieves relevant information as needed.
5. **AI Response Generation**: The Web App sends queries to OpenAI, which generates responses. These responses are processed and sent back to the user.

## API Integration
- **Pull API**: The overarching API that facilitates communication between the User Interface, Web App, and Azure Search components.

## Conclusion
This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, detailing each component and its interactions. By following this documentation, users and developers can understand and work with the system effectively.
